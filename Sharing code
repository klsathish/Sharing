Hi Team,

I would like to kindly share a clarification regarding the feedback from our last meeting.

It was mentioned during the discussion that the document is not aligned with the standards. However, it appeared that the complete document may not have been fully reviewed before this conclusion was made. We are currently updating the content to align with the expected standards, and I request that the revised version be reviewed in full before any final observations are shared. This will help ensure that the feedback is accurate and based on complete information.

In addition, I request that we please schedule a follow-up meeting once the updated document is shared, so that we can walk through the content together and address any queries.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
Please let me know a suitable time for the meeting.

Thanks & Regards,
K. L. Sathish

The Service Layer is the .NET application layer responsible for processing business logic. It receives requests from the Presentation Layer, executes the necessary business rules, and interacts with the Database Layer. Authentication has transitioned from Active Directory to Windows Authentication using the InfoPoint SQL Database, providing secure database-level authentication and authorization.



Big Data & Analytics – Data Flow Description
1. Source System – SAP S/4HANA
SAP S/4HANA acts as the enterprise transactional system and the primary source of business data. Operational data such as financial transactions, order processing records, production details, and logistics information are continuously generated and stored within SAP S/4HANA.
This data is exposed to downstream analytical systems through scheduled data extraction processes. Only approved business-critical datasets are extracted based on predefined integration rules, ensuring both security and relevance of the transferred data.
2. Data Replication to Big Data Platform
The extracted SAP S/4HANA data is replicated into the Big Data environment using secure data-movement services. Replication occurs either near-real-time or batch-scheduled depending on the data domain and performance requirements.
During replication, data undergoes:
Initial preparation and validation
Structure alignment for analytical processing
Storage in a scalable Big Data repository
This ensures that large-volume enterprise datasets are available for analytical modelling without impacting the transactional workload of SAP S/4HANA.
3. Analytical Processing – RM Model (RabbitMiner)
The replicated Big Data repository serves as the input source for the RabbitMiner (RM) analytical model.
RabbitMiner performs advanced data-science processing such as:
Pattern detection
Predictive modelling
Trend and behavioural analysis
Risk and performance scoring
The model transforms raw enterprise data into actionable analytical insights. These insights are then structured as RM Model Output datasets, which are optimized for business reporting and operational decision support.
